How to Compile the Inventory & POS System Installer Using Inno Setup Compiler
=============================================================================

This guide provides detailed step-by-step instructions to compile the Inno Setup script into a Windows installer executable. It is designed for users without programming experience.

Prerequisites
-------------
1. A Windows PC (Windows 10 or 11 recommended).
2. Internet connection to download software.
3. The Inno Setup script file: `InnoSetupScriptComplete.iss` (provided in the project folder).

Step 1: Download and Install Inno Setup Compiler
------------------------------------------------
1. Open your web browser and go to: https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php
2. Download the latest version of Inno Setup (e.g., "Inno Setup 6").
3. Run the downloaded installer file.
4. Follow the installation wizard steps:
   - Accept the license agreement.
   - Choose the installation folder (default is fine).
   - Complete the installation.

Step 2: Prepare the Project Files
---------------------------------
1. Ensure the entire Inventory & POS System project folder is organized as follows:
   - `app/backend` folder with backend code.
   - `app/frontend` folder with frontend code.
   - `scripts` folder containing `backup_and_installer_setup.bat`.
   - Batch files `start-backend.bat` and `start-frontend.bat` in the root folder.
   - The Inno Setup script file `InnoSetupScriptComplete.iss` in the `installer` folder.

2. Verify the relative paths in the Inno Setup script match your folder structure.

Step 3: Open the Inno Setup Compiler
------------------------------------
1. Launch the Inno Setup Compiler from the Start Menu or desktop shortcut.
2. In the Inno Setup Compiler window, click on "File" > "Open".
3. Navigate to the `installer` folder inside your project directory.
4. Select the file `InnoSetupScriptComplete.iss` and click "Open".

Step 4: Compile the Installer
-----------------------------
1. After opening the script, click the "Compile" button (green arrow) on the toolbar or press `F9`.
2. The compiler will start processing the script.
3. Watch the "Messages" pane at the bottom for progress and errors.
4. If there are errors, read the messages and fix any path or syntax issues in the script.
5. If compilation succeeds, you will see "Compile successful" message.

Step 5: Locate the Installer Executable
---------------------------------------
1. After successful compilation, the installer executable will be created in the `Output` folder inside the `installer` directory.
2. The file will be named `InventoryPOSInstaller.exe` (or as specified in the script).
3. You can copy this `.exe` file to any Windows machine for installation.

Step 6: Run the Installer
-------------------------
1. Double-click the `InventoryPOSInstaller.exe` file.
2. Follow the installation wizard prompts.
3. When prompted, enter the required environment variables:
   - `DATABASE_URL` (your PostgreSQL connection string).
   - `JWT_SECRET` (a secure secret key).
4. Complete the installation.
5. Use the created shortcuts to start backend and frontend servers.

Additional Tips
---------------
- Always test the installer on a clean Windows machine or virtual machine before distribution.
- Keep the Inno Setup script updated if you change project structure.
- Backup your project before making major changes.
